## üåü Project Overview

The stock market is a complex, non-linear, and highly volatile system. This project steps into the domain of **Algorithmic Finance** by leveraging the power of **Deep Learning** and **Time Series Analysis** to forecast future stock closing prices. It aims to transform raw, historical trading data into a predictive model that can offer insights into potential market movements.

This repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration of how to implement, train, and evaluate a state-of-the-art predictive model using the robust Python data science ecosystem.

-----

## üéØ The Predictive Goal

The primary objective is to develop a robust **Machine Learning model** capable of predicting the *closing stock price* for a given asset based on its historical performance.

1.  **Data Preparation:** Clean, normalize, and restructure time-series data for model ingestion.
2.  **Model Training:** Train an advanced Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on the prepared dataset.
3.  **Performance Validation:** Evaluate the model using key metrics like **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to quantify prediction accuracy.
4.  **Visualization:** Generate visual comparisons between the actual vs. predicted stock prices.

## üß† Model Architecture: LSTM

The core of this predictor is a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network. LSTMs are a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) uniquely designed to handle sequences and remember patterns over long periods. This characteristic makes them the ideal choice for analyzing and forecasting highly sequential and temporal data like stock prices.

The model learns from sequences of past prices to forecast the next time step, effectively capturing the *momentum* and *long-term dependencies* in the market.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

This project is built entirely within the Python ecosystem, utilizing popular tools for data science and deep learning:

| Category | Tool / Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | `Python` | The core programming language. |
| **Deep Learning** | `TensorFlow` / `Keras` | Framework for building and training the LSTM model. |
| **Data Manipulation** | `pandas`, `numpy` | Essential tools for data loading, cleaning, and array operations. |
| **Visualization** | `matplotlib`, `seaborn` | Creating charts to visualize historical data and model predictions. |
| **Environment** | `Jupyter Notebook` | Interactive environment for data exploration and model development. |

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized to clearly separate the codebase, data, and presentation material:

```
Stock-Price-Prediction/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code/                         # Contains the main Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for training/prediction.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/                     # Placeholder for the raw CSV/data files used for training.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                     # You are reading this file!
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ STOCK PRICE PREDICTION FINAL2.pptx # A presentation detailing the project's methodology and results.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cis-backend.zip               # Zipped source code/backend files (for a full application).
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database.zip                  # Zipped copy of the database files.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src.zip                       # Zipped source files.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python and the required libraries installed. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aditidinesh05/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
    cd Stock-Price-Prediction
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Note: Since the exact dependencies file is not provided, you will need to infer and install the required libraries like TensorFlow, Pandas, etc.)*
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy tensorflow keras matplotlib
    ```
3.  **Run the analysis:**
    Open the primary notebook file (likely located in the `code/` folder) to execute the data processing, model training, and prediction steps.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
